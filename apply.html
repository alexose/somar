        <p>
            I would like to invite you to spend one week at our property in Southern Oregon for the express purpose of working on an artistic endeavor of your choosing.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have an easel, canvases, paintbrushes, a typewriter, large format printer, sewing machine and thread, guitar, drums, keyboard, microphones, drafting table, 3d printer, laser cutter, soldering station, power tools and hand tools, and many other useful items that could factor into your work.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll help create an environment where you can be at your most creative and most productive.  This includes food, lodging, whatever supplies, equipment, physical spaces, advice, or moral support that we're reasonably able to offer.  The goal is to be partners in your project!
        </p>

        <p>
            The application process is noncompetitive and nonexclusionary by design.  If you're reading this, you are eligible.  Please contact somar@alexose.com with a short description of your project and desired dates.
